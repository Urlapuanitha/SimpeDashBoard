INSIGHTS:
BRAND VS COUNT OF ENGINE:

The "Brand vs. Count of Engine Insights" in a Carsales dashboard typically visualizes the number of engine-related observations for each car brand, helping identify which brands have the most or fewest insights. This could indicate the popularity, reliability, or focus on certain brands. The analysis might use bar or pie charts to compare brands and could include filters for more specific insights, like engine type or year, offering a quick overview of engine performance trends across different manufacturers.
YEAR BY YEAR GROWTH:

The "Year Over Year Growth" in a Carsales dashboard measures the percentage change in key metrics like sales or engine insights from one year to the next. This visualization helps identify trends over time, highlighting which years saw the most significant growth or decline. Typically shown using line charts or bar graphs, it provides a clear view of performance trends, enabling quick assessment of how metrics have evolved annually, and helps in forecasting future performance.
POPULAROTY OF DIFFERENT ENGINES:

The "Popularity of Different Engines" in a Carsales dashboard visualizes which engine types (e.g., V6, electric, hybrid) are most favored by consumers. This can be represented using bar charts or pie charts, showing the proportion or count of each engine type across the dataset. The analysis reveals consumer preferences, trends in engine technology adoption, and can be filtered by factors like brand or region, offering insights into market demand for various engine types.
